Downloads
~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started using Undertow is to download the
link:http://www.wildfly.org/download/[Wildfly Application Server].

Undertow is the default web server in Wildfly, so usage is as simple as deploying a war.

Maven
~~~~~

If you want to embed Undertow then you will most likely want to use Maven. Add the following to your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Beta1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Beta1</version>
</dependency>
----

You will only need the Undertow Servlet artifact if you wish to use Servlet in your application.

If you just want to download the jars directly you can download them from
